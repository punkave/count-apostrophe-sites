This tool counts Apostrophe sites being monitored via a particular Uptime Robot account and breaks them down by the version of Apostrophe used. It also totes up any non-Apostrophe sites found and reports on errors and pre-production URLs.

Make a `config.js` file that looks like:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  uptimeRobotApiKey: 'xxxyyy'
};
```
